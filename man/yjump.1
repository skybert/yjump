.TH YJUMP 1 "2024" "yjump 1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
yjump \- fast window switcher for macOS with fuzzy search
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yjump
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B yjump
is a fast window switcher for macOS that allows you to quickly jump to any window of any application on any workspace. It provides a fuzzy search interface similar to rofi on Linux/i3, enabling you to type parts of a window name or title to quickly locate and switch to it.
.PP
When invoked,
.B yjump
displays a search interface with an input box where you can type to filter windows. The search uses fuzzy matching, so you don't need to type the exact window title \- just enough characters to uniquely identify the window you want.
